# Notes
- select firstname from Author WHERE firstname like 'R%'
	- '%' is a wildcard
- select title, pages from Book WHERE pages >= 290 AND pages <= 300
	- WHERE pages between 290 and 300
		- Values are inclusive
		- Easier and quicker to write
- select firstnam, lastname, country from Author
	- WHERE country='AU' OR country='BR'
	- WHERE country IN ('AU', 'BR')
- order by clause
	- select title from Book
		- ORDER BY title 
			- Default is ascending order
		- ORDER BY title DESC
			- Descending order
	- You can also order by column index 
		- ORDER BY 2
			- Sorts by 2nd column
- Eliminating duplicates
	- select country from Author
		- ORDER BY 1
- SELECT column_names FROM table_name GROUP BY column_names HAVING condition
- Built in Functions
	- Most databases come with built-in SQL
	- Reduce network bandwidth
	- Aggregate or Column functions
		- Sum(), Max(), Min(), ect.
	- select SUM(Cost) from PetRescue
	- select SUM(COST) as SUM_OF_COST from PETRESCUE
	- select MAX(Quantity) from PETRESCUE
	- select LENGTH(ANIMAL) from RESCUE
	- UCASE, LCASE for lower case or upper case
		- select * from PETRESCUE where LCASE(Animal) == "cat"
		- select DISTINCT(UCASE(Animal)) where UCASE
	- DATE and TIME
		- DATE - 8
		- TIME - 6
		- TIMESTAMP - 20 digits
		- select DAY(RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL="Cat"
- Sub queries and Nested Selects
	- select COLUMN1 from TABLE where COLUMN2 = (select MAX(COLUMN2) from Table)
	- One limitation of aggregate functions is that they can't always be evaluated in where class
- Select EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, SALARY
	- from employees where SALARY < (select AVG(Salary) from employees)
- Subselect does not need to go in where clause
	- It can go in column (Column Expression)
		- Select EMPY_ID, SALARY, AVG(SALARY) as AVG_SALARY from employees
- Substitute the TABLE name with a sub-query
	- Called derived tables or table expressions
- Working with multiple tables
	- select * from employees where DEP_ID IN (select DEPT_ID_DEP from DEPARTMENTS)
- select * from employees, departments
	- Every row in the firs table is combiend with a row in the second table (Full Join)
- Implicit Join: Select * from employees, departments where employees.DEP_ID = departments.DEPT_ID_DEP;
	- select * from employees E, departments D where E.DEP_ID = D.DEPT_ID_DEP
- select EMP_ID, DEP_NAME from employees E, departments D where E.DEP_ID = D.DEPT_ID_DEP
